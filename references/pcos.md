# PCOS-Friendly Diet Guidelines

## Core Principles
- **Higher protein**: 25-35% of calories from protein (lean meats, fish, eggs, legumes)
- **Lower carb**: 30-40% of calories from complex carbs (not keto-strict)
- **Anti-inflammatory**: Omega-3 rich foods, turmeric, ginger, leafy greens
- **Blood sugar stable**: Low glycemic index foods, pair carbs with protein/fat

## Prioritize
- Lean proteins: chicken breast, turkey, salmon, cod, eggs, greek yogurt
- Non-starchy vegetables: broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, kale, bell peppers, zucchini
- Healthy fats: olive oil, avocado, nuts (almonds, walnuts), seeds (flax, chia)
- Complex carbs (moderate): sweet potatoes, quinoa, brown rice, oats, lentils
- Berries: blueberries, strawberries, raspberries (lower sugar fruits)
- Fermented foods: sauerkraut, kimchi, plain yogurt/kefir

## Limit
- Refined carbs: white bread, white pasta, white rice
- Added sugars: candy, soda, sweetened drinks, pastries
- Highly processed foods: packaged snacks, fast food
- Inflammatory oils: soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil (prefer olive/avocado)
- Excessive dairy: some dairy is fine, but monitor tolerance
- Red meat: occasional is fine, lean cuts preferred

## Avoid
- Trans fats
- Artificial sweeteners (in excess)
- Alcohol (in excess; occasional wine okay)
- High-mercury fish (swordfish, king mackerel)

## Meal Structure
- Include protein at every meal (30g+ target per main meal)
- Fill half the plate with non-starchy vegetables
- Use healthy fats for satiety
- If including carbs, pair with protein/fat to blunt glucose response
- Crock-pot meals are great for PCOS: slow-cooked proteins, bone broth, stews

## Practical Notes
- Batch cooking proteins on Sunday saves time
- Rotisserie chicken is a budget-friendly protein source
- Frozen vegetables are nutritionally equivalent to fresh and often cheaper
- Canned beans/lentils are fine (rinse to reduce sodium)
- Eggs are one of the most affordable complete proteins
